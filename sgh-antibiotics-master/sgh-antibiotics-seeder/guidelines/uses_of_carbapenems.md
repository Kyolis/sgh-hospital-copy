## GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF CARBAPENEMS

### 1. Empiric Use
>**1. Appropriate Criteria A:**  
Patient has evidence of infection AND clinically unstable with Oxygen saturation.

>**2. Appropriate Criteria B:**  
Patient has severe nosocomial or healthcare-associated infections, and failed to improve despite 48-72 hours of appropriate empiric therapy as ***per Guidelines, AND Cultures remain negative***

>**3. Appropriate Criteria C:**  
Prior isolation of (within last 3 months):  
(a) Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria, ***OR***  
(b) Enterobacter spp or Serratia spp (that can produce Amp-C beta-lactamases), ***OR***  
(c) Gram-negative bacteria sensitive only to carbapenems.


>**4. Appropriate Criteria D:**  
As per recommendations in the CGH Antimicrobial Guidelines  
As recommended by Infectious Disease physician

---
### 2. Definitive Use (Culture-directed)
>**1. Appropriate Criteria A:**  
(a) Infections caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria, ***OR***  
(b) Multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria sensitive only to carbapenems, ***OR***  
(c) Infections caused by Enterobacter spp or Serratia spp, either  
      - Positive cultures at non-sterile sites resistant to other antibiotics 
      (e.g. ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole), ***OR***  
      - Positive cultures at sterile sites (Blood, CSF, Bone)

>**2. Appropriate Criteria B:**  
(a) Allergy and/or intolerance to active penicillins and/or cephalosporins and organism is resistant 
to other classes of antibiotic, ***OR***   
(b) Contraindications (e.g. severe renal impairment) to other antibiotics (besides carbapenem) 
that the isolate is sensitive to.

### 3. Review of Microbiological Results
>#### Whenever cultures are positive:  
>De-escalate from carbapenems to an effective antibiotic with the narrowest spectrum 
(i.e. culture directed therapy)

>(Items 1 to 5 must be fulfilled before de-escalation)  
>1. Afebrile (temperature < 37.7C for 48 hours)  
>2. Inotropes discontinued  
>3. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) normal or > 100mmHg  
>4. If on mechanical ventilation and FiO2 < 0.4,   
Respiratory rate < 25 breaths/min and SpO2 > 92% on room air  
>5. Reduction in white blood cell count  
>6. Reduction in C-reactive protein or procalcitonin  
>7. Physician assessed patient to have improved clinically
