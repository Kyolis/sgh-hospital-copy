## OUTPATIENT PARENTERAL ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY (OPAT)

>### Benefits of OPAT:
>1. Potential cost reduction  
>2. Reduction in length of hospital stay  
>3. Alleviation of hospital bed crunch situations  
>4. Reduced risk of developing nosocomial infections  
>5. Earlier return to productivity at work or school  

>### Considerations for Patient Selection:
>1. The patient should be clinically stable with an infection that is non-progressive. 
>2. Patients or their caregivers must be able to assume responsibility of the infusion, the care of the vascular access device and the catheter infusion site, as well as to be able to recognise and report new problems, such as rash, diarrhoea or fever. Factors that can affect compliance should be looked into, such as mental capacity, visual acuity, manual dexterity and strength, psychosocial issues, pain or immobility.
>3. Injection drug use or alcohol abuse problems should be specifically evaluated before therapy is initiated. Patients who are likely to abuse a vascular access system will not be considered for OPAT.
>4. Patients must have a means of immediate communication (telephone or mobile telephone) and transportation for physician appointments and emergency services.
>5. Patients should be informed of the economic and medical aspects of OPAT before initiation of therapy. They should be counselled regarding Medisave coverage and the anticipated out-of-pocket costs to allow for an informed decision before OPAT begins.
>6. Daily treatment in the clinic is an option for selected patients, with sufficient transport means, who are receiving antibiotics that can be administered once daily.
>7. The health care team should have knowledge of the patient's home environment prior to initiation of OPAT. This information is ideally obtained by a visit to the home, but verbal assessment may suffice. Patients should have running water, adequate light and refrigerators to store compounded medications. In the event that recovery is slower than expected, a home visit may be required to determine possible contributing environmental factors.

>### Common Infections Treated with OPAT:
>- Endocarditis
>- Intra-abdominal abscess
>- Liver abscess
>- Melioidosis
>- Osteomyelitis
>- Pyelonephritis
>- Septic arthritis
>- Skin and soft tissue infections

>## Frequently Used Antibiotics in the OPAT Setting:
>**1. Daily Clinic Treatment**  
>Antibiotics that can be dosed once-daily:
>- Amikacin
>- Ceftriaxone
>- Daptomycin
>- Ertapenem
>- Gentamicin
>- Vancomycin (patients with renal dysfunction or the elderly)
>- Meropenem (patients on intermittent haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis)
>- Teicoplanin
> 
>**2. Continuous Infusions**  
>Antibiotics with good stability in solution can be prepared in elastomeric pumps:
>- Aztreonam
>- Cefazolin
>- Cefepime<
>- Ceftazidime
>- Ceftriaxone (high dose 4g)
>- Ciprofloxacin
>- Flucloxacillin
>- Penicillin G
>- Piperacillin/Tazobactam
>- Vancomycin

>### Referrals for OPAT
>All referrals should be made to the infectious disease physician for assessment of suitability for OPAT.

>### Home Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (HPAT)
>Bedbound patients or those with ambulatory issues can opt for Home Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (HPAT). Nurses from the OPAT service will travel to the patient's home to administer the parenteral antibiotics. Unfortunately at this point in time, this service cannot be paid for using Medisave.
