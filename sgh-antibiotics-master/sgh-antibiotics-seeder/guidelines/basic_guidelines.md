## BASIC GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS

 > 1. Antibiotics should not be prescribed for suspected viral infections.
Antibiotics should be used only for diagnosed bacterial infections or in seriously ill patients suspected of having bacterial infections. They may also be used for prophylaxis in certain well recognised situations.

> 2. Antibiotics are selected on the basis of their efficacy, relative toxicity and cost. The shortest possible duration of treatment should be selected.

> 3. Consider the necessity of reducing the dose of antimicrobials in patients with renal impairment. The dosage of some antimicrobials (especially vancomycin and aminoglycosides) may have to be modified.

> 4. Consider the necessity of reducing the dose of antimicrobials in patients with renal impairment.

> 5. Anti-pseudomonal agents (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems) should be considered for empiric treatment of infection in patients with burns, neutropenia or septic shock.

> 6. For parenteral treatment of intra-abdominal or pelvic anaerobic infection, IV metronidazole rather than IV clindamycin is recommended since IV metronidazole is significantly cheaper. Remember that beta-lactam/ beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. Augmentin, Unasyn) and carbapenems (e.g. Imipenem, Meropenem) are also effective against anaerobes.

> 7. For surgical prophylaxis where indicated, a dose is administered 60 minutes before the skin incision and should be discontinued within 24 hours after the operative procedure.

> 8. Restricted antibiotics require authorisation by Consultants, registrars or ID Physicians and should be accompanied by supporting culture.

> 9. Standard dosage is adequate for moderately severe infections. Increased dosage may be given to neutropenic patients, patients on steroids and diabetics. Maximum dosage may be given to patients with meningitis, endocarditis and osteomyelitis.

> 10. Consequences of inappropriate use of antibiotics include:  
    (a)  Antibiotic resistance  
    (b)  Adverse drug reactions  
    (c)  Increased cost  
    (d)  Emergence of *Clostridium difficile* infection
